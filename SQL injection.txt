Today, I have learnt about SQL injection and its types. 
With these, I also performed a hands-on lab on "Retrieving hidden data" and "Subverting application logic".

1) In first lab, the idea was to comment all the rest of the sql query and just focus on the name and its always true statement. 
   And that was: '+or+1=1

2) Here, we subverted the query as: we didn't knew the password so we just entered the administer'-- and that was all to do.
